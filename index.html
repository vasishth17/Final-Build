            <p class="lb_text">
                Michael is a former bank robber and career criminal who faked his death to retire and live a peaceful
                life with his family in Los Santos. However, his unhealthy relationship with them takes its toll and he
                soon gets pulled back into his criminal life, forcing him to return to his old ways
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                This is believed to be a reference to Michael. Fans may recall that he became a film producer in GTA V,
                and this line of dialogue seems to confirm that Michael is still alive and still doing that job. GTA V
                had three story endings, and in one of them, Michael dies. In another, Trevor dies.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Franklin was born in South Los Santos, San Andreas in 1988. He never knew his father and his mother
                became a cocaine addict when Franklin was very young. As a child, Franklin often heard stories about his
                father was domestically abusive towards his mother, possibly causing her to turn to cocaine to escape
                being abused.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Franklin is described as being an ambitious young man and eager to take on new, and often illegal, new
                challenges. He also exhibits a lot of hope in the actions that he does, acting as a contrasting
                character to other protagonist Michael De Santa. He develops a strong relationship with Michael, often
                acting as a father-son duo.

                Jimmy is the son of Michael and Amanda De Santa, and the younger brother of Tracey. Born in 1993, he and
                his family lived in a trailer park in the Midwest while his father, Michael, ran a career in bank
                robbing. At some point, Michael's partners-in-crime, Trevor Philips and Brad Snider met Jimmy and his
                family.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Throughout the game, Jimmy De Santa is mostly seen getting into trouble after which Michael has to
                rescue him. In the very beginning he finds himself on his fatherâ€™s boat that had been stolen while he
                tried to sell it to some people. Michael along with Franklin rescue him from this situation. His
                relationship with his father gets better as the story progresses and despite the barriers between them,
                Jimmy and his father are quite close.

                identities for their family. She struggles in bringing up her children and handling Micahel at the same
                time.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Living their new life in Los Santos, the relationship between Amanda and Michael becomes very sour, the
                two barely tolerating each other. Despite this, she remained faithful to Michael until she caught him
                having sex with a stripper, leading to her cheating as an act of revenge on Michael with many different
                men.
